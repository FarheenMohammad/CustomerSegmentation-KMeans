📌 Overview
This project implements Customer Segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. It aims to group customers into different segments based on purchasing behavior and demographic patterns. Businesses can use these insights to develop targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer experience, and improve operational decisions.

📈 Objective
1. Identify distinct customer groups based on selected features such as Annual Income, Spending Score, and other demographic details.
2. Visualize clusters to understand customer patterns.
3. Help businesses make data-driven decisions for personalized marketing.

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. Scikit-learn

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is a sample customer dataset containing:
1. Customer ID
2. Gender
3. Age
4. Annual Income (k$)
5. Spending Score (1–100)

You can use the Mall Customers Dataset available on Kaggle or any equivalent dataset.

🔍 Methodology
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection
3. Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
4. Apply K-Means Clustering
5. Visualize the resulting customer segments.

📈 Results
